### Records

The base unit of data in IDB is a [`record`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-record) and IndexedDB is capable of storing as records most standard types of JavaScript data. To copy values to the database, IDB uses something called the "[`structured clone algorithm`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-structured-clone-algorithm)".

IDB only stores JavaScript list objects, but the values associated with keys on those objects that can typically be any value that "[cloned](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-structured-clone)", which includes both the basic JavaSript primitives and more complex object types: null values, `Boolean`s, `Number`s, `String`s, `Date`s, `Array`s, other `Object`s and even advanced types such as RegExp, Blob, File, FileList and ImageData objects. The only standard object type IDB's structured clone algorithm cannot deal with are function objects. Thus JavaScript functions cannot be stored in their native object form.
