To get to objects, you have to through object stores, and to get to object stores you have to go through databases. So the first step in interaction with `IndexedDB` is almost always to open a database. Database open requests are instances of [`IDBOpenDBRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBOpenDBRequest).

Opening an existing database and creating a new one work in the same way: if the name passed matches an existing database, that database is opened; if the name doesn't match an existing database, a new one will be created when opened using a unique name. Opening a new database, or opening an existing database with a version greather than the current version, will trigger a `versionchange` event.

As written in the spec, an IDBDatabase interface "represents a connection to a database." There can be multiple connections at any given time. So long as a reference to that object exists, the connection should remain open unless closed explictly using the `close()` method on IDBDatabase.
