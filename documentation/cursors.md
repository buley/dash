Using an index and a key range for that index, you can use a "[`cursor`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-cursor)" to get, put and delete [`values`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-cursor-value) one at a time but in single request. Cursors are also capable of "[`advancing`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#widl-IDBCursor-advance)" and, in effect, skip a number of objects in an index for a given key range.

Cursors traverse an index matching a given "key range". There is no limit on the number of cursors that can be used at the same time.

Two different types of cursors: cursors that read just keys (instances of [`IDBCursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBCursor)) and cursors that read keys and values [`IDBCursorWithValue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBCursorWithValue) which are created on an index using the [`openKeyCursor`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#widl-IDBIndex-openKeyCursor) and [`openCursor`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#widl-IDBIndex-openCursor) methods respectively.
