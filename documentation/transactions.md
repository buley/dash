In IDB, work [tasked](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-task) to a database [queue](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-queue-a-task) is called a "[`transaction`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transaction)". A transaction is an instance of [`IDBTransaction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBTransaction) and characterized by its "[`scope`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-scope)". Transaction scope, in turn, is characterized by both the work to be done and where the programmer wants the work to happen. To create a transaction against an open database, a programmer names the object stores on which she'd like to operate, and optionally specifies what type of transaction she'd like to create.

There are three "[`modes`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-mode)" of transactions: "[`readwrite`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-read_write)", "[`readonly`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-read_only)" and "[`versionchange`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-version_change)". These are an instance of an interface called IDBTransactionMode. The default is "readonly", convienient because changing a data via a "write" is generally more expensive than to "read" that data. The granularity and providing of "readonly" vs. "readwrite" offers the programmer an the opportunity to speed up her code depending on her needs. The final transaction type, "versionchange", is used when changing the schema of a database.

The [`lifetime`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-transaction-lifetime) of a transactions lasts as long as it's referenced: it's "`active`" so long as it's being referenced, after which it is said to be "`finished`" and the transaction is [`commited`](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#dfn-commit).
